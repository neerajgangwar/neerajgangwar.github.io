Most recently, I was a software engineer at [Myntra](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/myntra/).

Previously, I worked with two friends on a couple of startup ideas - Shoplane (a hyperlocal shopping app for fashion) and AIANash (AI-driven analytics to understand user intent). I was also part of the engineering team at [Commonfloor](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/commonfloor/).

I completed my bachelor's and master's degrees in [Electronics and Communication Engineering](http://ece.iitr.ac.in/) from the [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/) in 2014. I worked with [Prof. Debashis Ghosh](http://ece.iitr.ac.in/debashis_ghosh) and [Prof. MV Kartikeyan](https://www.mvkartikeyan.com/). I was also a member of [SDSLabs](https://sdslabs.co/).
