I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). I am a part of [the MLP Group](https://mlpgroup.xyz) and am advised by [Prof. Nickvash Kani](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/kani).

Prior to joining grad school, I spent seven years in the software industry. I was part of the engineering teams at [Myntra](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/myntra/) and [Commonfloor](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/commonfloor/). I also worked with two friends on a couple of startup ideas - Shoplane (a hyperlocal shopping app for fashion) and AIANash (AI-driven analytics to understand user intent).

I completed my bachelor's and master's degrees in [Electronics and Communication Engineering](http://ece.iitr.ac.in/) from the [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/) in 2014. I worked with [Prof. Debashis Ghosh](http://ece.iitr.ac.in/debashis_ghosh) and [Prof. MV Kartikeyan](https://www.mvkartikeyan.com/). I was also a member of [SDSLabs](https://sdslabs.co/).
