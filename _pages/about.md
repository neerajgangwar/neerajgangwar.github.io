I am a software engineer at [Myntra](https://tech.myntra.com/){:target="\_blank"}.

Previously, I worked with two friends on a couple of startup ideas - Shoplane (a hyperlocal shopping app for fashion) and AIANash (AI-driven analytics to understand user intent). I was also part of the engineering team at [Commonfloor](https://commonfloor.com/){:target="\_blank"}.

I completed my bachelor's and master's degrees in [Electronics and Communication Engineering](http://ece.iitr.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"} from the [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"} in 2014. I worked with [Prof. Debashis Ghosh](http://ece.iitr.ac.in/debashis_ghosh){:target="\_blank"} and [Prof. MV Kartikeyan](https://www.mvkartikeyan.com/){:target="\_blank"}.
